Problem Statement: Write a program to scan and output the similar sections of text between two input files.

This program searches through the two input files and detects similar sections of text between them.
A section of text is defined as a consecutive group of words with a specified word count.
To find similar sections of text, the program will search for common words between both text files.
Then, the program will compare text sections centered around a common word, counting the number of common words in both sections.
The program will output the sections of text between both files that are similar.

The program also must do this efficiently and quickly in order to handle large text files.
